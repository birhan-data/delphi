    <h3>Questionnaire: Determining Interventions for Effective ANC Coverage using Delphi Approach</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Dear Sir/Madam,<br><br>
    I hope this message finds you well. HaSET in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH) is conducting a study
    on effective antenatal care (ANC) coverage using the data from the Birhan field site. The aim of this study is to
    estimate the quality-adjusted (effective) coverage of attendance to at least 1 and 4 ANC visits during pregnancy in
    the Birhan cohort. You are identified as one of the experts in ANC for the Delphi questionnaire to prioritize the
    effective ANC measurement options across the visits from ANC 1 through ANC 4 based on the MOH guideline that was
    implemented until 2022 with a recommendation of 4 visits and specific interventions using the focused antenatal care
    (FANC) model.
  </p>
  <p>The information gathered will be always kept confidential, during processing, analysis, and report write-up. The
    information will be stored separately from identifying information through a cross-link identifier. At no time will
    responses ever be linked to identifiers, including after publication, to protect respondentsâ€™ confidentiality.
  </p>
  <p>A consensus workshop will be held with preliminary results of the responses from this Delphi exercise to bring out
    the best effective ANC coverage measures.
  </p>
  <p>This work does not have any personal benefit or risk to you as an individual or as a group, but our goal is that it
    will help to improve MNCH evidence generation and translation into policy/program intervention in Ethiopia. The
    research team will be responsible for the dissemination of findings through publications and workshops.
  </p>
